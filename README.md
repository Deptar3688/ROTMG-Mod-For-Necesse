# ROTMG-Mod-For-Necesse
Status: In Progress

A mod that'll add enemies, bosses, items, and hopefully also dungeons to the game Necesse.

First plans are to add ~~1 enemy (Knight of Oryx)~~ **[complete]**, 1-2 bosses (Stone Guardians), a custom island with custom tiles and walls (Oryx's Castle), and 4 weapons (sword, bow, wand (mage), staff (summoner))

Secondary plans are 2 more enemies (Brute of Oryx, Haunted Armor), a new debuff (Armorbreak), 4 armor sets (1 for each class), a new ability (healing tome), and another boss (Oryx the Mad God)

## Licenses
This mod is open source. Feel free to use any of my code in your own mods and change them however you like. Giving me credit is greatly appreciated but not necesse-ary.
